# A simple Rust-based stack machine

## What is a virtual stack machine?

As said on [Stack machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_machine) article
from Wikipedia, is a simple process that can be handle by a computer processor
or by a virtual machine in which the interaction is related to a stack structure,
based on LIFO model.

So you have two operations to handle it: `push` and `pop` and everything that you
will do is based on it.
